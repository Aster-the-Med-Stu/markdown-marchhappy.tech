> 医学并不是一门完美的科学，而是一个时刻变幻、难以琢磨的知识系统。不断进步的科学技术指引着我们，当然也有习惯和本能，还要靠一些经验，有时还有运气，然而我们知道的和我们追求的目标之间总会存在一些差距，不过正是这个差距驱使我们更努力地做每一件事。

> We look for medicine to be an orderly field of knowledge and procedure. But it is not. It is an imperfect science, an enterprise of constantly changing knowledge, uncertain information, fallible individuals, and at the same time lives on the line. There is science in what we do, yes, but also habit, intuition, and sometimes plain old guessing. The gap between what we know and what we aim for persists. And this gap complicates everything we do.
